## Background

The rapr package began as MATLAB code in 2012 following the publication of "New Metrics for Assessing Diagnostic Potential of Candidate Biomarkers" (Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, 2012). The package provides comprehensive tools for assessing the comparative performance of logistic regression models, particularly in the context of biomarker evaluation and clinical prediction model improvement.
